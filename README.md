# Tata Capital FastAPI Agentic AI Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project is a **web-based Agentic and Generative AI chatbot** built to automate the **personal loan journey** for BFSI use cases such as Tata Capital.  
The chatbot interacts with users in natural language while autonomously executing backend tasks like eligibility checks, credit score validation, and loan approval generation.

## Problem Statement
Traditional loan approval systems are slow, manual, and spread across multiple disconnected platforms. This leads to delays, higher operational costs, and poor customer experience.  
The goal of this project is to provide a **secure, intelligent, and automated loan processing solution** that delivers faster decisions and seamless user interaction.
